						<h2>About us.</h2>
						<p>U.S. Army Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (JROTC) is a congressionally mandated program that focuses on the youth-oriented mission “Motivating Young People to be Better Citizens”. It is one of the largest youth programs in the world with more than 310,000 high school students participating annually while enrolled in over 1,700 secondary educational programs and encompasses a myriad of teaching goals focused on leadership, teamwork, character education, personal responsibility, a sense of accomplishment, and service to the nation. Two of the most important assets for JROTC are the Cadets/students and the nearly 4,000 instructors who lead, guide, and mentor their Cadets. Because of the significance of the mission, United States Army Cadet Command (USACC) has established an enhanced means of communicating both within the command and externally through the U.S. Army JROTC Web Portal. The Web Portal provides the media for JROTC Cadets and instructors to connect to the world and for the world’s public audience to communicate with the Army JROTC program.The JROTC Web Portal is a dynamic communications tool that has both a public side and a Private side. The public side provides access to general information on the JROTC Program and news about our Cadets, while the private side is reserved for our instructors. Instructors have access to the following web pages: Education & Curriculum with such items as Distance Learning, Curriculum On-line, Education Technology, Textbooks, Accreditation, and other items of interest; Instructor Management which includes Instructor Pay, CNACI, Interview Course Skills, etc; Training & Operations which includes JSOCC Courses, Co-Curricular Events, Logistics, Marksmanship & Safety program, Institute of Heraldry, etc; Automation to include Lifecycle Replacement program, JUMS, and JCIMS.Recent changes to the JROTC Web Portal have enhanced its appearance, accessibility, and ease of locating items of interest. We are committed to continuing improvements to make it even more professional and convenient. Please email the JROTC Web Developer to provide feedback and comments on how we can make the JROTC Web Portal a better tool for your use.Thank you for all that you do for our nation..</p>
