							<h2>The learning?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The curriculum is facilitated and taught by retired Army personnel. Qualified retired Army personnel are employed by the schools to teach the JROTC curriculum. JROTC teacher qualifications are based on military experience, maturity, stability, and leadership acquired over 20 years of service to our nation. To safeguard the viability of the JROTC program, the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Education endorse the proposition that states recognize that JROTC instructors are certified to teach JROTC and the array of subject areas embedded (e.g., Physical Education, Health/Wellness, Civics, etc.).
JROTC is a successful program, making substantial contributions to students, schools, and communities which benefit greatly from its presence. The benefits of JROTC are reflected in metrics impacting all schools in the U.S.</p>

						<h3> The U.S. Army JROTC Curriculum</h3>
						<p>The JROTC curriculum, which fully or partially addresses a number of national academic standards - to include Common Core State Standards (CCSS) - includes course work on leadership, civics, geography and global awareness, health, and wellness, language arts, life skills, and U.S. history. The curriculum is based on the principles of performance-based, learner-centered education and promotes development of core abilities: capacity for life-long learning, communication, responsibility for actions and choices, good citizenship, respectful treatment of others, and critical thinking techniques.More important than “what” is learned in JROTC is “how” it is learned. Every classroom is equipped with leading edge technologies to teach, assess, and report student progress. Teachers are trained to utilize a range of technologies and develop social/emotional skills, support academic content through gaming and simulations, and promote the role of social media. Thus, students engage in meaningful, purposeful activities that lead them to demonstrate success through a portfolio of accomplishments. </p>
