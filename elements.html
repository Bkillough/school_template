						<h3> Why we have who we do? </h3>
						<p>The U.S. Army Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) is a program offered to high schools that teaches students character education, student achievement, wellness, leadership, and diversity. It is a cooperative effort between the U.S. Army and the high schools to produce successful students and citizens, while fostering in each school a more constructive and disciplined learning environment. The outcomes of the JROTC program are:

Act with integrity and personal accountability as they lead others to succeed in a diverse and global workforce
Engage civic and social concerns in the community, government, and society
Graduate prepared to excel in post-secondary options and career pathways
Make decisions that promote positive social, emotional, and physical health
Value the role of the military and other service organizations
With the schoolâ€™s support, the JROTC program achieves these outcomes by using a world-class 21st Century, technology driven, student centered curriculum. The curriculum consists of education in citizenship, leadership, social and communication skills, physical fitness and wellness, geography, and civics. </p>
